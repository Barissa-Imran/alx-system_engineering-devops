## Specifics about this infrastructure:

## Additional elements:

We now introduce the SSL certification, Monitoring client, and firewall.

## What is an SSL Certificate?

The SSL certificate’s job is to initiate secure sessions with the user’s browser via the secure sockets layer (SSL) protocol. This secure connection cannot be established without the SSL certificate, which digitally connects company information to a cryptographic key. Any organization that engages in e-commerce, for instance, must have an SSL certificate on its web server to ensure the safety of customer and company information, as well as the security of financial transactions therein.

### How SSL Certificate Work:

A browser attempts to connect to a website (i.e. a web server) secured with SSL. The browser requests that the web server identify itself.

The web server sends the browser a copy of its SSL certificate.
The browser checks to see whether or not it trusts the SSL certificate. If so, it sends a message to the web server.
The web server sends back a digitally signed acknowledgment to start an SSL encrypted session.

Encrypted data is shared between the browser and the webserver.

### What do you stand to gain by using SSL certificates?

- Utilize HTTPS, which elicits a stronger Google ranking
- Create safer experiences for your customers
- Build customer trust and improve conversions
- Protect both customer and internal data
- Encrypt browser-to-server and server-to-server communication
- Increase the security of your mobile and cloud apps

## Firewalls:

It is a program that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an organization’s previously established security policies.

They scan packets for malicious code or attack vectors that have already been identified as established threats. Should a data packet be flagged and determined to be a security risk, the firewall prevents it from entering the network or reaching your computer. ( In general, the purpose of a firewall is to reduce or eliminate the occurrence of unwanted network communications while allowing all legitimate communication to flow freely.)

## Why is the traffic served over HTTPS?

Because a https connection requires an SSL certificate. This certificate’s job is to initiate secure sessions with the user’s browser via secure sockets layer (SSL) protocol. This secure connection cannot be established without the SSL certificate which digitally connects company information to a cryptographic key.

## What monitoring is used for?

Infrastructure monitoring is used to collect health and performance data from servers, virtual machines, containers, databases and other backend components in a tech stack. This system has 3 monitoring systems and hence it can be used to visualize, analyze and alert on metrics and understand whether an issue is impacting users.

## How Infrastructure Monitoring Works:

It tracks the availability, performance, and resource utilization of hosts, containers, and other backend components. Engineers typically install software, called an agent, on their hosts. i.e physical servers, or virtual machines which use the resources of a physical server. The agent collects infrastructure metrics from hosts and sends the data to a monitoring platform for analysis and visualization. Infrastructure monitoring provides visibility into the health of backend components that run the applications, ensuring that critical services are available for users and that they work as expected.

Infrastructure monitoring provides visibility across multiple layers of the tech stack, including the hardware, the operating System(OS), and the application server. The hardware layer includes the physical components, such as memory chips and the processor, that your backend components use to function.

## Note:

An organization’s applications and services can only work well for users when the underlying backend infrastructure is healthy. Infrastructure monitoring allows engineers to spot and prevent problems anywhere in the backend, which minimizes downtime and service degradation for users. Operations teams, DevOps engineers, and site reliability engineers (SREs) typically rely on infrastructure monitoring to troubleshoot or prevent any problem.

## Issues with the infrastructure:

- Terminating SSL certificate at the load balancer is an issue because it will make the same insecure to attacks and may lead to a mismatch in the protocols used to access the system

- Having only one MYSQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue because if the master goes down, the application cannot write to the database anymore.

- Having servers with all the same components(database, Web server, and application server)might be a problem because:
  i) Their consumption will not grow the same way between each of them[Hence a need to have more database servers than application servers]
  ii) When there is maintenance performed on a server for a specific component, it will affect other components there on it.
